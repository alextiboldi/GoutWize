# Auth State Storage

This directory stores Playwright authentication state (`user.json`) generated by `auth.setup.ts`.

The auth state file is gitignored and regenerated on each test run.

## Setup

Set these environment variables for E2E tests:

```
TEST_USER_EMAIL=<test account email>
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=<test account password>
```
